Hello everyone, I am Mike O'Donnell. I'm interested in back end development, Arduino projects, 3d printing, and many other hobbies.

I'm currently learning a bit more about front end development and plan on being a bit more active here on github.

If you're trying to reach me in regard to one of my few repositories, the best place is via my email mike@devferret.com

I'll update this page sometime soon as I have a few active projects going on to "reinvent" my online presence.
